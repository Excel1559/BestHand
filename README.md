# Poker Project

Created a best poker hand calculator using typescript and the deck of cards api https://deckofcardsapi.com/

## Getting Started

To get started in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install `
### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode on port 3000.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How it Work

Once the app is running you will be prompted to load a new deck.
After a new deck has been loaded you will have the option to shuffle the deck or draw a hand of five cards.
Upon drawing a new hand the cards will be displayed on the screen as well as the calculated best hand.
You can then continue drawing five new cards until their are only two cards remaining in the deck.
Once their are only two cards remaining the option to draw five new cards will be removed, and you will only be able to shuffle those two remaining cards or load an entirely new deck.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
